# TheBlog

Simple Blog web app using Elixir, Phoenix, and Postgresql. It is currently not production ready but it does have nice freatures for keeping a text centered blog. 

Feel free to Fork at will.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
